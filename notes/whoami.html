        My nate is Nate. I have been a freelance full-stack web developer for 5 years now,
        but my experience with web technologies goes back over 2 decades.
    </p>
    <p>
        I began developing websites around the time that Netscape was taking over from Mosaic.
        This was the time when frames and tables were the only options for layout.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been around for the full gamut of layout options through the history of the web,
        and nothing has gotten me more excited than CSS Grid.
    </p>
    <p>
        We're in an amazing time for web development now as so many technologies and specs have matured.
