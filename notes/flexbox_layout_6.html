        The big disadvantage to Flexbox is that it only works in one direction at a time.
        Either horizontally or vertically, but not both.
    </p>
    <p>
        So if you want to change directions, you have to embed another flexbox that is configured for the other axis.

        This is an example of the grid system in Bootstrap4.
        This is only two levels deep, but you can see how quickly it adds up to create markup that's just as bad as tables.
