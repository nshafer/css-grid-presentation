        Responsive layout with Flexbox is similar to floats, but instead of floating each <b>col</b> at the breakpoint,
        we instead just turn on <b>display: flex</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this example we also swap the order of the elements.
        This is commonly used for a menu (orange) that we want above the main content (blue) on phones,
        but on desktops where we have the room, we want the content to be more prominent and the menu to be on the side.
    </p>
    <p>
        To be clear, this is possible with floats, but it involves some tricky hacks involving pushing and pulling
        columns around to get the same results.

        Bootstrap4, just released in August of 2017 has migrated their grid system completely to be flexbox-based.
        It is much nicer to use.
