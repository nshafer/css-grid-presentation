        Using <b>Grid Area</b> templates allows for really simple rearrangement of content at different breakpoints,
        making the layout responsive very easily.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this example, at the mobile breakpoint we just let the blocks stack like blocks, one after another.
        No CSS Grid needed for this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then at tablet widths, we merge the menu and the header, rearranging their order on the page without changing their
        order in the HTML, and putting them side-by-side.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, at desktop widths, we put the menu next to the content, and the header and footer span the whole width.
