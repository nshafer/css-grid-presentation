        One of the latest tools for layout is Flexbox.
        Flexbox places all of it's immediately child elements on a single axis.
        It includes a lot of nice features over floats such as the ability to grow and shrink elements based on a 'weight'
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>(Next slide)</i>
        This shows the first column receiving a weight of <b>3</b> while the second column gets <b>1</b>.
        This effectively makes the width of the first column <b>3/4</b>, and the second <b>1/4</b>.
        This allows a lot more dynamic markup without having to calculate widths.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>(Next slide)</i>
        Another advantage of Flexbox is the ability to align items vertically (cross-axis).
        This wasn't really possible with floats without some truly horrendous hacks.
        Here we align them to the bottom.
    </p>

        Flexbox also allows you to easily change the order of each child element with the <b>order</b> property.
