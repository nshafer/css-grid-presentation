    <p>
        In the beginning web pages were entirely linear and flowed from top to bottom.
        They were designed to be a document with hyperlinks.
    </p>
    <p>
        There was only semantic markup, meaning each part of the page had specific elements and a default style.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you wanted to change things you only had a few tools, such as
        <code class="language-html">&lt;b&gt;</code> for bold,
        <code class="language-html">&lt;i&gt;</code> for italics and
        <code class="language-html">&lt;font&gt;</code> for changing colors (now deprecated).
