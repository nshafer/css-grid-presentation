        So what is the problem that CSS Grid is trying to solve?
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike print media, modern websites need to be responsive to any device,
        such as mobile phones, tablets, desktops or anything else that might become popular in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        Until now, all layout on the web has been done by using a series of hacks to accomplish that goal.
        For example: Tables, floats and flexbox.
    </p>
    <p>
        CSS Grid allows you to place elements anywhere in a grid,
        and change that placement in response to size of the viewport through media queries.
