        Unlike print media, modern websites need to be responsive to any device,
        such as mobile phones, tablets, desktops or anything else that might become popular in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each one of these examples was created with the exact same markup, just rearranged and placed using CSS Grid.
    </p>
    <p>
        CSS Grid allows you to place elements anywhere in a grid,
        and change that placement in response to size of the viewport through media queries.
